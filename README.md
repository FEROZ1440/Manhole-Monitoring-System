Aim:
  To automate the manhole monitoring.
Action:
  To achieve this we came up with an idea that ,we need to monitor two things 1.Whether manhole is closed or open i.e whether there is a lid or not.
  and 2.The water level beneath the lid to predict the water blockage.
As of now the data available on status page is manually updated data.But this is not the actual purpose of our project.As we mentioned earlier we want to automate 
the manhole monitoring for this we are using Arduino uno and two ultrasonic sensors to monitor water level and lid status.
But we are facing problem in sending data to server using arduino uno.
